I realize that most of what I did for the included files was probably extra, and unnecessary.
The only reason I did any of it was because I tried to teach myself a lot of C++ over break,
so I mainly used this assignment as an excuse to test some of that knowledge.

All of the 'extra' stuff I used (classes, exceptions, etc.) I learned from learncpp.com over break.
